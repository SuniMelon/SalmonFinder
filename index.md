## My Poems

### A boy named shea

There once was a boy named Shea
He went outside one day
A storm was forming
And the earth was warming
So Shea hoped to live another day

### Pierce the Pepper Boy

Pierce picked a patch of peppers

These pepers he put in his pipe of pepper picking

Pierce piped the patch of picking peppers, putting the peppers in Pierces picked pepper pocket.

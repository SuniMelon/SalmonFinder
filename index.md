## My Poems

### A boy named shea

There once was a boy named Shea
He went outside one day
A storm was forming
And the earth was warming
So Shea hoped to live another day

### Pierce the Pepper Boy

Pierce picked a patch of peppers

These pepers he put in his pipe of pepper picking

Pierce piped the patch of picking peppers, putting the peppers in Pierces picked pepper pocket.

Some information about salmon:

- They are an anadromous species of fish in the Salmonid family (I'm not sure actually)
- They used to be abundent in Europe, but recently (not so recently) they have declined to the point of near extinction
* I am worried about my thesis a little! I went through and edited most of it, but on the last day there was so many comments and edits and I went through and changed a lot, but I can only hope everything makes sense!

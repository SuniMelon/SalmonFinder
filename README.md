# SalmonFinder



## Purpose (Why)

Finish my senior project for a salmon map website by May 16, 2024.

This project will create an interactive map following the patterns and larger historical events of salmon and the rivers they live in. Specifically, it will show the yearly population trends of a number of rivers in Alaska from the oldest data available to the newest. In addition to this, the maps will record and present historical information of interest depending on the year. For example, if a dam was constructed or destroyed, the map will state it and the year it happened. This will hopefully demonstrate how salmon are impacted by dams and other anthropogenic qualities. 

### Quotes from Users

> “Wow! I saw how salmon have declined in areas of Alaska… following the construction of the Yukon dam the king salmon disappeared… devastating.” - said SallySalmonLover from Fairbanks, AK, a SalmonMap user. 

## Principles (How) - (Unless you know better ones…)

1.  Spend no more than $50 total. We are biased towards begging, borrowing, and stealing vs getting the credit card out. Frugality breeds innovation.
Unless the funds are received through Griptape/Senior Project applications

2. Learn New Shit. Always be learning as we move forward.

3. Mostly Solo. Involve people to help (learn), but this is my project.

4. Accurate data. Make sure the data gathered is accurate and provides the best information to the customer. If given the choice of making data up, or finagling it to fit, I choose to call out that data is missing or may be misleading. 

5. Flexibility. All of these principles can be adjusted to an extent. 

## Priorities (Order and Mass)

1. Create a plan
2. Dive deep into the data to determine what’s out there and what’s usable
3. Determine states/regions to focus on
4. Alaska primarily, Washington if we have time
5. Determine if it will be one map with links or 2+ maps with individual data
6. Colorado isn’t a priority anymore*
7. Find data
8. Finish GripTape application
9. Figure out what needs money
10. Domain name - $30 (one year)
11. Web hosting - $20/mo (fund for one year) - $240
12. Design the customer experience – What do users see, and what can they do?
13. Consolidate the data
14. Build spreadsheet for it
15. Learn how to build a website
16. Build website

## Questions

1. Should there be a domain name? If so, what is it? (Max budget $15/yr).
(www.salmonfinder.com)
(www.asalmonsjourney.com)
(www.historyofahero.com)
All of these are ideas, not set in stone
2. How do we limit the amount of data for the MLP?
